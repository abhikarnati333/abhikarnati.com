      Hey! I’m <a class="underline hover:text-red-500">Abhi Karnati</a> — a developer, designer, and just a curious guy trying to build meaningful things in this ever-evolving world of tech.
    </h3>
  </div>

      I got into coding not because I had to — but because I wanted to <strong>create</strong>. It started off with curiosity and turned into a full-on obsession. I remember building my first program as a teenager, watching lines of code turn into something that responded, moved, or solved a problem — and I was hooked. That feeling hasn’t left me since.
      <br /><br />
      I’m currently a Software Engineer and Webmaster Intern at the 
      <a href="https://www.hindutemplemn.org" target="_blank"
        class="underline underline-offset-4 hover:opacity-50">Hindu Society of Minnesota</a>, where I build systems that help the nonprofit better serve its members. Before that, I worked at 
      <a href="https://www.wayzataschools.org" target="_blank"
        class="underline underline-offset-4 hover:opacity-50">Wayzata Public Schools</a>, helping with tech operations. Both roles taught me not just how to write better code, but how to be part of something bigger — how to listen, adapt, and serve.

      <p class="text-lg md:text-2xl leading-relaxed">
        When I’m not coding or designing, I’m probably out playing tennis, lifting at the gym, or hanging out with friends. I love late-night conversations, spontaneous road trips, and listening to music that makes me float in the clouds. 
        Life moves fast, and I try to stay grounded in moments — because as the quote goes: <span class="italic bg-gradient-to-r from-red-500 to-orange-500 bg-clip-text text-transparent">"You'll never know the value of a moment until it becomes a memory."</span>
        
      </p>
  
      <p class="text-lg md:text-2xl mt-5 leading-relaxed">
        I’m super passionate about blending <strong>tech with emotion</strong> — I don’t just want to build useful tools, I want to build things people connect with and makes them <span class="italic">feel</span> something. Whether it’s a slick UI, a backend that just works, or a product that solves a real problem, I care about the entire experience. That’s why I’ve been diving deep into full-stack development, while also studying user behavior, interaction design, and performance optimization.
      </p>
  
      <p class="text-lg md:text-2xl mt-5 leading-relaxed">
        I’ve built AI-powered music tools, nonprofit automation systems, games, educational platforms — and I’m just getting started. Every project teaches me something new, and every new challenge reminds me why I fell in love with this work.
      </p>
  
      <p class="text-lg md:text-2xl mt-5 leading-relaxed">
        If you’re working on something meaningful, interesting, or just plain weird — I’d love to hear about it. I’m always open to chatting, collaborating, or just vibing over shared ideas.
      </p>
