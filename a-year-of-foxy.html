                  <p>
                    The heart of <em>A Year of Foxy</em> lies in its atmosphere. From glowing forests to snow-covered ruins, every level was carefully designed to evoke curiosity and wonder. Each environment plays a role in both gameplay and storytelling, offering subtle narrative clues within the terrain.

                  <p>
                    With Unity as the engine, I utilized 2D sprite animation and physics-driven movement to ensure fluid control. Each level was tested extensively for flow, difficulty balance, and player satisfaction.

                  <h2 class="font-medium underline underline-offset-4">Gameplay & Challenges</h2>
                  <p>
                    The platforming mechanics combine smooth jumping physics with a variety of interactive elements—moving platforms, timed gates, secret passages, and dynamic terrain.
                  </p>
                  <img class="rounded-2xl mx-auto w-full max-w-4xl" src="/images/a year of foxy/shot_2.jpeg" alt="Gameplay Screenshot 2" />
                  <p>
                    I introduced an evolving difficulty system where obstacles scale as players gain mastery. The objective wasn’t just to create a challenge—but to encourage player growth and reward clever problem-solving.

                  <p>
                    Each world in the game reveals parts of a broader narrative: a fox seeking meaning through seasons of change. Dialogues with NPCs, discovered artifacts, and background cues hint at a larger story that invites players to piece it together.

                  <p>
                    <em>A Year of Foxy</em> was my first major game design project and remains one of my most fulfilling creative works. It taught me how to blend narrative, art, and code into a playable story—and how to think like both a developer and designer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As I continue exploring game development, I hope to expand this universe and share Foxy's journey with a broader audience, potentially on web or mobile platforms.
