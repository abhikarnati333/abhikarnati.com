              Deevo is an AI-powered music platform that generates intelligent,
              personalized playlists based on user prompts. With a clean
              interface and one-click Spotify export, Deevo empowers users to
              discover music in a way that feels natural, creative, and deeply
              personal.

                <p>
                  I built Deevo to scratch my own itch. I wanted a smarter, more
                  intuitive way to find music that
                  <span class="italic">feels</span> right.

              The Inspiration
            </h2>
            <p>
              I was tired of skipping through half-hearted Spotify playlists.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’ve always been the go-to music guy in my friend group—the one
              making playlists for late-night drives or pre-game hype. But when
              I wanted something new and specific, existing tools failed. I was
              either stuck typing vague keywords into Spotify or hoping Reddit
              had a thread for "lofi study jams with 80s synths".
            </p>
            <p>That frustration sparked the idea:</p>
            <div class="flex gap-4 items-center">
              <div class="w-1.5 bg-pink-500 h-20 md:h-14 rounded-sm"></div>
              <div>
                <p>
                  What if you could just <span class="italic">tell</span> an app
                  what vibe you're feeling—and it builds the perfect playlist?
                </p>

            <h2 class="font-medium underline underline-offset-4">
              How I Built It
            </h2>
            <p>
              What was supposed to be a weekend project turned into a
              full-fledged app that took months...
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Frontend:</strong> Built with React + Tailwind CSS. I kept
              the UI minimal—soft colors, centered focus, and no distractions.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Backend:</strong> Built with NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB.
              I used the Spotify API to get the music data and the Google Gemini
              API to generate the playlists. Implemented custom authentication
              with JWT tokens and secure password hashing with bcrypt, plus
              Spotify OAuth to handle playlist exports.
            </p>

              <div class="w-1.5 bg-green-500 h-28 md:h-20 rounded-sm"></div>
              <div>
                <p>
                  This project taught me how to balance clean code with
                  real-time API orchestration—without compromising on user
                  experience.
                </p>

              Making AI Understand Music Vibes (Prompt Design)
            </h2>
            <p>
              Getting Deevo to return playlists that actually made sense wasn’t
              just about calling an API. I wrote pages and pages of prompt
              instructions—carefully crafting how genres should be mixed, how
              songs should be formatted, and how to avoid repetition. Each small
              change in phrasing could dramatically shift the results.
            </p>
            <p>
              Eventually, I found a sweet spot between creative freedom and
              structured control—where the AI could surprise me but still stay
              on theme. I also built in fallback logic and auto-cleaning to
              handle weird outputs like “Track: Unknown.”

            <p>
              Deevo’s interface was designed to feel calm, intentional, and
              emotionally engaging. I avoided clutter, used soft contrasts, and
              centered the experience around the user’s imagination and
              emotional state. The entire app is also built with mobile in mind,
              so it's responsive and works on any device.

            <p>
              The magic of Deevo happens when a user types a mood-based prompt
              and gets a full playlist in seconds. This section highlights the
              real-time responsiveness and delight of that interaction.

              Deevo’s stack is built with modularity and performance in mind.
              The frontend and backend are fully decoupled, and all playlist
              generation and export flows are async with fallback logic.

              Building Deevo was an iterative process full of small wins and

              <li>
                <strong>✅ Worked:</strong> Seamless Spotify export felt magical

              <li>
                <strong>✅ Worked:</strong> Prompt tuning with Gemini returned
                surprisingly emotional, relevant songs.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>❌ Didn’t:</strong> Handling malformed AI responses
                required building post-processing logic.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>❌ Didn’t:</strong> Spotify API rate limits forced some
                backend restructuring
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>❌ Didn’t:</strong> Prompt tuning was more art than
                science (spent hours testing subtle wording)

                Prompt engineering is equal parts logic and creativity—writing
                for AI is its own skill.
              </li>
              <li>
                Designing for emotion matters—users remember how it made them
                feel more than how it worked.
              </li>
              <li>
                Full-stack projects require zooming in and out constantly—from
                database schema to typography.
              </li>
              <li>
                Shipping something imperfect still beats waiting for
                perfect—iteration beats hesitation.

              Final Thoughts
            </h2>
            <p>
              Deevo reminded me why I love building: it combined technical
              depth, user empathy, and a creative problem space. This wasn’t
              just a full-stack build—it was a conversation between design, AI,
              and music.
            </p>
            <p>
              I didn’t just code an app—I designed an experience that people
              could emotionally connect with.

            <p>
              Deevo started as a side project but evolved into one of the most
              rewarding things I’ve built. It brought together everything I care
              about—clean design, emotional resonance, and purposeful
              engineering.
            </p>

              If you're interested in how I built it, want to contribute, or
              just want to vibe to a new playlist
