              The Hindu Society of Minnesota (HSMN) is a non-profit organization
              committed to serving the spiritual, cultural, and social needs of
              Minnesota‚Äôs Hindu community. To support its yearly operations,
              HSMN relies on the generosity of donors‚Äîand with that comes the
              responsibility of providing accurate, timely, and personal
              donation statements.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a Software Engineering Intern, I contributed to building
              <strong>Financial Yearly Reports Sender (FYRS)</strong>‚Äîa system designed to
              automate the generation and delivery of individualized donation
              receipts to each donor via email.

              The Problem
            </h2>
            <p>
              Every year, HSMN sends hundreds of donation summaries manually.
              This manual process was time-consuming, error-prone, and lacked
              personalization. Additionally, tracking which receipts had been
              sent (and which had failed) was often messy and inefficient.
            </p>
            <p>
              The organization needed a solution that could:

            <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
              <li>Generate accurate donor-specific reports</li>
              <li>Send them automatically via email</li>
              <li>Track delivery status in a centralized location</li>
            </ul>

              How I Built It
            </h2>
            <p>
              I worked on the backend logic of FYRS, focusing on spreadsheet
              integration and data processing using <strong>Python</strong>. We
              used the <strong>Google Sheets API</strong> to store donor data and
              update delivery statuses.
            </p>
            <p>
              A JSON template was used to dynamically generate donation letters
              personalized for each recipient, pulling in their donation amount,
              frequency, and name. The tool then used SMTP libraries to email
              each statement and update the Google Sheet with a "Sent" status
              once completed.
            </p>
            <div class="flex gap-4 items-center">
              <div class="w-1.5 bg-purple-800 h-20 md:h-16 rounded-sm"></div>
              <div>
                <p>
                  My contributions helped streamline the workflow for HSMN‚Äôs
                  admin team and brought a human touch to donor communication
                  through personalized automation.

            <p>
              This was a meaningful project that combined automation, user
              empathy, and nonprofit impact. I learned how to design systems
              that are not only technically functional but also improve the
              lives of those relying on them.
            </p>
            <p>
              I‚Äôm proud to have played a role in helping HSMN modernize their
              donor communications and look forward to evolving this system
              further in the future.
